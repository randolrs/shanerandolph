		<h2>Design</h2>

		<p>I create responsive, mobile-first web applications using front-end frameworks, including AngularJS, Bootstrap, Jquery, and plain-old CSS media queries.</p>

		<p>I think it is important to solve design challenges with the knowledge that web design is fundamentally a form of communication -- sending a message <i>accurately</i> between the developer and the end-user. As a result, I measure the effectiveness of my designs first and foremost based on user data (conversion rate, engagement, etc.)</p>

		
		<p>Some of my recent design work includes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a>Hiro Asian Kitchen</a></li>
			<li><a>ComedyHere</a></li>

		</ul>

		<p>...development plus design is moot without marketing ...</p>
